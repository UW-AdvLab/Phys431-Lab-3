Fit the above using two different methods: (A) linearize the data, then fit to a line and obtain the slope and intercept, and (B) fit to the functional form of equation (1) in the instructions.  From both ways of fitting, find the critical temperature at zero field $T_c$ and the critical field at 0K $H_{c0}$.\n",
